# ExampleScaleHighPt

Example code is ExampleScaleCorrection.C, in order to test the simple example: 

root -l ExampleScaleCorrection.C+.

In order to modifiy the muon curvature according to its correction and uncertainties on-the-fly in an alaysis code:

Include directly the function GeneralizedEndpointPt() defined in 

include/GeneralizedEndpointPt.h

In the analysis code.
